Put your WooCommerce catalog inside ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity. AI shoppers find your products, see live prices and stock, and complete the purchase through your existing checkout.

== Description ==

Shopping has moved into AI chat. Buyers ask ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude and Perplexity what to buy long before they touch a search engine — and most WooCommerce stores are invisible in those conversations.

xpay is the WordPress plugin that fixes that.

* Publishes a public, agent-readable product feed (your full catalog, with live prices and stock)
* Adds the `Product`, `Offer`, and `BuyAction` JSON-LD that AI shopping agents look for
* Serves `/llms.txt` and `/.well-known/agentic-commerce.json` — the discovery files every modern AI shopper checks
* Allows GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot and OAI-SearchBot through `robots.txt`
* Lets AI agents create a pre-filled cart deeplink that lands the buyer on your existing WooCommerce checkout
* Your existing payment gateway (Stripe, WooPayments, PayPal, Square) handles payment — payouts arrive exactly as they do for a normal online sale

What it doesn't do: touch your theme files, replace your checkout, hold your money, or require a new payment processor.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `xpay-for-woocommerce` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` (or install via WP admin > Plugins > Add New).
2. Activate the plugin.
3. Go to **Settings → xpay** and click **Connect store**.
4. Approve the WooCommerce REST API permissions when prompted.
5. Your catalog goes live across AI surfaces within ~10 minutes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this slow down my site? =
No. The plugin emits a small `<script type="application/ld+json">` block in `<head>` and a `/llms.txt` route. Both are cached. The catalog feed is hosted on xpay's CDN, not your origin.

= Does xpay see my customers' payment info? =
No. Payment runs through your existing WooCommerce gateway. xpay never touches checkout.

= What if I already have Yoast / Rank Math emitting Product schema? =
xpay detects the existing schema and only adds the bits it's missing (typically `BuyAction` on PDPs and `ItemList` on the homepage).

= Does the plugin send any data to xpay? =
Only what you opt in to. (a) The catalog feed sync sends your public product data (names, prices, stock, images) to xpay's CDN so AI surfaces can read it — this is required for the plugin's core function and is enabled when you click **Connect store**. (b) Optional anonymous telemetry (plugin activated, store connected, sync errors, etc.) is **off by default**. We ask once via an admin notice; you can change the choice any time under **Settings → xpay → Privacy**. No customer data, order data, or PII is ever sent. See the **External services** and **Privacy** sections below for the full list.

== External services ==

This plugin connects to xpay-operated services to deliver its core function. Every endpoint is documented here.

1. **agent-feed.xpay.sh** — The public, AI-readable catalog feed for your store at `https://agent-feed.xpay.sh/catalog/{your-slug}.json`. The plugin does **not** contact this URL directly; the xpay backend writes it from your WooCommerce REST API after you click **Connect store**. This URL is referenced from `/.well-known/agentic-commerce.json` on your domain so AI shoppers can discover it.

2. **agent-commerce.xpay.sh** — The agent-side API that AI shopping agents call when they want to surface or buy from your products. The plugin contacts `https://agent-commerce.xpay.sh/v1/{slug}/resync` to trigger a fresh catalog ingest after a product/stock change. The plugin also receives signed cart-deeplink redirects at `/?xpay_cart=<JWT>` which lands the buyer on your existing checkout.

3. **app.xpay.sh/onboard/woocommerce** — The merchant-side onboarding screen the **Connect store** button opens in a new tab. You sign in or sign up on xpay and approve the connection there.

4. **install.xpay.sh** — Auto-update channel (manifest + zip) for sites that installed the plugin from `xpay.sh/install/woocommerce` instead of WordPress.org. WordPress.org installs use WP.org's update system and never contact this host.

5. **agent-commerce.xpay.sh/v1/events** — Optional anonymous telemetry endpoint. Disabled by default. Only contacted if you explicitly opt in. See **Privacy** below for the exact payload.

Terms of use: https://xpay.sh/terms
Privacy policy: https://xpay.sh/privacy

== Privacy ==

xpay is built non-custodially: we never see your customers, your orders, or any payment data. Concretely:

* **What the plugin always sends** (after you click **Connect store** — required for the plugin to work): your site URL, your WooCommerce REST API consumer key/secret (so xpay can read the product catalog), and the public product fields (name, description, price, stock, image URLs, categories). No customer data. No order data. No payment data.

* **What the plugin optionally sends** (only if you opt in to the **anonymous telemetry** prompt — default OFF): lifecycle events tagged with your site URL, plugin version, WP version, WC version, PHP version, and locale. Event names include: `plugin_activated`, `plugin_deactivated`, `settings_viewed`, `connect_clicked`, `finalize_success`, `finalize_error`, `audit_rerun_clicked`, `audit_rerun_success`, `audit_rerun_error`, `disconnected`, `resync_success`, `resync_error`. No customer data, no order data, no PII.

* **How to opt out of anonymous telemetry:** open **Settings → xpay → Privacy** and click **Turn off**. Or define `XPAY_WC_TELEMETRY` to `false` in `wp-config.php` for a system-wide hard disable.

* **How to delete data:** Click **Disconnect** under **Settings → xpay**, then deactivate and delete the plugin. The plugin's `uninstall.php` removes its local options. To request deletion of catalog data from xpay's CDN, email privacy@xpay.sh.

== Screenshots ==

1. One-click connect — your existing checkout stays untouched.
2. Eight audit checks, all green: catalog feed, JSON-LD, llms.txt, well-known, robots, BuyAction, cart deeplink, fresh inventory.
3. Your catalog, live on agent-feed.xpay.sh — real prices, real stock.
4. AI chat → your existing checkout: ChatGPT/Claude surface your product, buyer lands on your cart pre-filled.
5. JSON-LD on every PDP including BuyAction — view-source proof.
